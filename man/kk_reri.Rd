\title{Relative Excess Risk due to Interaction (RERI)}
\usage{
kk_reri(model, exp1, exp2, conf.level = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A glm object (family = binomial)}

\item{exp1}{Name of first exposure variable (string)}

\item{exp2}{Name of second exposure variable (string)}

\item{conf.level}{Confidence level (default 0.95)}
}
\value{
Tibble with RERI estimate and CIs (using delta method)
}
\description{
Calculates RERI (Relative Excess Risk due to Interaction) on the additive scale
using a logistic regression model.
Assumes the model contains two binary exposures and their interaction.
Model formula should be roughly: outcome ~ exp1 * exp2 + covariates
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
model <- glm(outcome ~ exp1 * exp2 + age, family = binomial, data = df)
kk_reri(model, "exp1", "exp2")
}
}
